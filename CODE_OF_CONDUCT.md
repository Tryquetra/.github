# Community Code of Conduct

Welcome. This community is dedicated to Balanced Ternary Computing.

Our primary goal is to foster deep, substantive discussion and productive collaboration. To maintain this focus, all participation is governed by the following principles.

### The Four Exclusions

This community is not a public square for all topics. To protect our focus and signal-to-noise ratio, the following discussions are strictly off-limits:

* **No Religion**
* **No Ideology or Partisan Politics**
* **No News or Current Events**
* **No Hype, Speculation, or "Vaporware"**

Discussions on these topics will be removed immediately.

### Our Core Principles

We operate based on realism, logic, and a respect for demonstrated knowledge.

#### 1. Argue from First Principles
This is a community built on substance, not opinion.
* **Substantiate Your Claims:** Arguments, proposals, and assertions must be supported by evidence, data, sound logic, or clear first principles. Unsupported claims will be challenged.
* **Embrace Realism:** We discuss what *is*, not what we wish to be. Idealistic or wishful-thinking arguments that ignore reality will not be entertained.
* **Identify Fallacies:** We expect rigorous thought. Pointing out logical fallacies in an argument is not an attack; it is a core part of our quality control.

#### 2. Stand on the Shoulders of Giants
We value and build upon existing knowledge.
* **Do Your Research:** Before asking a question or proposing a new idea, demonstrate that you have researched the existing body. Reference established work, documentation, or prior discussions.
* **Attack the Argument, Not the Person:** We encourage strong, critical debate. You may—and should—challenge ideas, code, and arguments. You must not, however, resort to *ad hominem* or personal insults.
* **Be Direct and Clear:** Communicate your ideas efficiently. We value clarity and conciseness. (A good practice is to state your conclusion first, then your supporting arguments).

#### 3. Maintain a High Signal-to-Noise Ratio
Your contribution should add value.
* **No "Low-Effort" Content:** Avoid content-free posts (e.g., "+1", "This", "I agree," or just an emoji). If you agree, add new information, context, or a constructive viewpoint.
* **Stay on Topic:** Keep discussions tightly focused on the community's purpose.

### Enforcement

Violation of these principles will result in the removal of content. Repeated or flagrant violations will result in removal from the community. We will always prioritize the integrity and focus of the group over the participation of any single individual.

Live Long and Prosper 🖖🏻
