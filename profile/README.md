### 🏛️ Our Mission: The Power of Three

Welcome to **Tryquetra**.

Our name is inspired by the *triquetra*, an ancient symbol representing the union of three parts. It perfectly mirrors our mission: to redefine modern computing by moving beyond the binary, harnessing the power of three-state logic.

We are a deep-tech systems research and engineering company focused on a singular goal: to design, build, and popularize balanced ternary computer architecture.

### 💡 Why Balanced Ternary?

The digital world was built on binary (bits: 0 or 1). However, standing on the shoulders of giants — reviving and modernizing the pioneering concepts of machines like the Setun — we see a more efficient path.

We believe **balanced ternary** (trits: $\{-1, 0, +1\}$) is the next logical step in the evolution of computation.

* **Information Density:** A single "trit" stores more data than a "bit" ( $\log_2 3 \approx 1.58$ bits), enabling fundamentally denser data processing and storage.
* **Arithmetic Efficiency:** Mathematical operations are inherently more elegant and efficient in balanced ternary. The representation of negative numbers (using $-1$) eliminates the need for workarounds like two's complement.
* **Robust Logic:** The "zero" (0) state is perfectly neutral, distinct from "false" (-1) and "true" (+1), allowing for a more expressive and robust three-value logic.

### 🔬 Our Projects

Our work is focused on building a complete ternary ecosystem, from the foundation to the software.

* **Hardware Architecture:** Designing and prototyping new CPU architectures (ISAs) and FPGAs based on ternary logic gates.
* **Software Ecosystem:** Building the essential tools—compilers, operating systems, and high-performance simulators—needed for developers to program for ternary hardware.
* **Research & Development:** Actively publishing our findings to foster an academic and open-source community around ternary computing.

### 🚀 Join the Ternary Evolution

Binary computing brought us this far. Ternary computing will take us forward.
